        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>NICE TO MEET YOU</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Hi! My name is Nilaksh Kashyap. My home state is Jharkhand, India, that is where I was born and raised. I am a 2nd year 
                student in Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, currently pursuing my degree for Bachelor's in Technology in 
                Computer Science and Enginering. I like solving problems and taking on challenges. I try to give my best in every task I am 
                presented with and do not shy from giving even extra hours to get the task done perfectly.
            </p>

        <h2>I LIKE DESIGNING</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Yes, I am interested in designing. I have been also designing posters for the instagram posts of my club which I am part
                of. I also like making abstract background designs and uploading it on websites such as freepik so that others can also 
                use these designs for free. I use industry standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Figma etc.
                for my designing.

        <h2>SOME HOBBIES</h2>
        <div>
            <p>My hobbies include matching movies, listening music, reading books, and gaming. Movies act as a fuel to me as it is almost a 
                 routine for me to watch a movie every saturday night. I listen to music almost everytime. While designing, while coding, 
                 or while excercising in gym I like to listen to music. Reading books is another of my favorite things as it helps me improve 
                 my vocabulary, while also entertaining me. While I do not play games very often however I somehow get some time
                 out in weekends for few hours of gaming.
            </p>

        <h2>SPORTS</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I like playing cricket and table tennis. Both these games are such that I can continuously play these games for hours.
                I am also a huge cricket fan. Along with cricket I also follow Kabaddi and MMA. I also go to the gym 3 to 4 days a week 
                to maintain a fit physique.
