        <h2>OTHER TECH INTERESTS</h2>
        <div>
            <p>My other interests in the tech field include robots. I am part of the robotics club in my college where i get to learn 
                more about this interest of mine. I have worked on few small wired bots using Aruduino and continue to learn more. I am 
                also part of a project where we want to create a robotic hand which can perform various tasks. My next goal includes 
                going into the field of Cyber Security as well as to become a Fullstack Developer.
